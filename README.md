This extension allows you to:

- Choose from a list of public server instead of letting the game choose for you.
- Save public and private server to a list.
- Get Ip address of the server you are currently playing.*

*To obtain the correct address of the server you must first press the play button to connect to it.

Thanks to Ketchup Girl for allowing me to use her clever code to obtain the ip from the server.
